# Morning Star page generators

Section-specific InDesign page generators for the [Morning Star newspaper](http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk), written in AppleScript and based off `core.scpt`. If you’d like to take at a look at it with GitHub’s syntax highlighting see `core.applescript`.

The individual applications (in the "Run-only apps" folder) are just `core.scpt` but a different parameter passed to `genPrompt()` on about line 35.
