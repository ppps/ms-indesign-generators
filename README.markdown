# Feral Four

## Morning Star page generators

These script files, with the exception of St Ann's.scpt, are section-specific page generators for the Morning Star.

* Paperboy — News
* Big Spike — Features
* High Brow — Arts
* Filbert Street — Sport

St Ann’s is just a storage script to hold the handlers used in the other four. The other scripts do not pull anything from it, but it contains the canonical versions of the handlers. Any changes made to them should be made in St Ann's first and then copied across.

The four generators need to be compiled as .app files before use.

### Icons

In the Icons folder are four .icns files to be applied to the generators when they’re compiled as applications. (⌘I, and drag the .icns onto default icon.)

There is also a single .psd file which serves as a template. As of 07/07/2012, it still needs updating to contain all the options as layers. Right now it just looks like the sport icon, which was the last one it was used to create.

## Updates

Should be made as separate branches. Named after [The Roots’ albums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roots_discography) for major updates, or tracks in the current version’s album for minor updates. For example, v1.11 would be TheresSomethingGoinOn and v1.2 IlladelphHalflife. (Indulge me.)
